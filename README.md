# Student-Management-System
Created a Student Management System with methods for setting details, calculating total marks, and displaying student info.
The motto is **"Encapsulating Student Data for Effective Management."**  

This program demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming by encapsulating student-related information within a class. The `Student` class defines attributes such as roll number, student name, and marks, ensuring that all relevant details are grouped together. By using methods like `setStudDetails`, `calculateTotal`, and `displayStudDetails`, the program promotes structured data handling.  

Encapsulation ensures that data remains secure and can only be modified using designated methods. The use of the `this` keyword helps distinguish between instance variables and method parameters, reinforcing good coding practices. The `calculateTotal` method processes data internally, while the `displayStudDetails` method presents the results, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns.  

The `StudentDemo` class acts as a driver to create and manipulate a `Student` object. It follows a step-by-step approachâ€”first assigning values, then computing total marks, and finally displaying student details. This program can be easily extended to manage multiple students, calculate grades, or integrate database storage for enhanced functionality.  

Overall, the code highlights the importance of encapsulation and object-oriented principles in creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable software applications for student record management.
